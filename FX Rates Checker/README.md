# Python Markets Scripts

For now this repository contains two Python scripts to check exchange rates from different APIs. 

## Scripts

1. **`exchange-rates-fixer.py`**  
   Uses the **Fixer.io API** to check exchange rates.  
   **Note**: This script only supports EUR as the base currency, and it allows you to check the rate of EUR against any target currency.

2. **`exchange-rates-er.py`**  
   Uses the **ExchangeRate-API** to check exchange rates.  
   **Note**: This script allows you to check exchange rates for various base currencies (e.g., EUR, USD, etc.) against a target currency.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.13

You will also need an API key for both Fixer.io and ExchangeRate-API.

## Setup

### 1. Install Required Libraries

Clone or download this repository, and then install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file contains:

```txt
requests
python-dotenv
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File

You will need to create a `.env` file in the project directory to store your API keys securely.

#### Example of `.env` file:

```env
FIXER_API_KEY=your_fixer_api_key_here
ER_API_KEY=your_exchangerate_api_key_here
```

### 3. Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and execute one of the following commands:

- To run the `exchange-rates-fixer.py` script:

    ```bash
    python exchange-rates-fixer.py
    ```

- To run the `exchange-rates-er.py` script:

    ```bash
    python exchange-rates-er.py
    ```

### 4. Using the Scripts

- Once the script is running, you will be prompted to enter a **target currency** (e.g., PLN).
- The script will then display the exchange rate between EUR and the target currency.
- You can continue checking rates or exit the script by pressing Enter without input.

#### Example usage (fixer.io):

```bash
Enter target currency (e.g., PLN), or press Enter to exit: USD
üåç Exchange Rate
============================
üí± 1 EUR = 1.2000 USD
============================

Enter target currency (e.g., PLN), or press Enter to exit: GBP
üåç Exchange Rate
============================
üí± 1 EUR = 0.9000 GBP
============================

Enter target currency (e.g., PLN), or press Enter to exit:
üëã Exiting. Have a great day!
```

### 5. API Key Notes

- **Fixer.io API**: [Sign up for a Fixer.io API key](https://fixer.io/signup).
- **ExchangeRate-API**: [Sign up for a free ExchangeRate-API key](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).

Ensure that you add the API keys to your `.env` file as shown in the setup section.
