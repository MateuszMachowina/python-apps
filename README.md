# Python Apps Collection

Welcome to my Python Apps Collection! Here I share various simple Python applications I've been working on. Each app demonstrates different Python concepts and libraries, and serves as a fun way for me to learn and experiment with Python.

## Apps

1. **World of Tanks Stats Viewer**  
   - A simple app that allows users to search for their World of Tanks player statistics and view detailed information about their most-used tanks.
   - Features:
     - Displays detailed tank stats like battles, win rate, average damage, and max frags.
     - Sorts tanks by different columns (e.g., Avg Damage, Max Frags).
     - Clean, interactive GUI using `tkinter`.
   
2. **Other Apps**  
   - This repository will continue to grow with different mini-projects I build as I learn more Python. Stay tuned for more!

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Requests (for API calls)
- Tabulate (for tabular output formatting)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-apps-collection.git
    cd python-apps-collection
    ```

2. Install the required packages (if any):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the desired application by running its respective Python script:

    ```bash
    python app_name.py
    ```
