# Simple Python Apps Collection

Welcome to my Python Apps Collection! Here I share various simple Python applications I've been working on. Each app serves as a fun way for me to learn and experiment with Python.

## Apps

### 1. **World of Tanks Stats Viewer**

A simple app that allows users to search for their World of Tanks player statistics and view detailed information about their most-used tanks.

**Features:**
- Search World of Tanks players by username  
- View total battles, win rate, and global rating  
- Display top-used tanks with detailed stats  
- Filter tanks by tier  
- Show mastery badges, average damage, frags, and more  
- Switch easily between players or sessions  
- API key handling via `.env` file or manual input  

### 2. **Other Apps**

This repository will continue to grow with different mini-projects I build as I learn more Python. Stay tuned for more!

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13  
- `requests` (for API calls)  
- `tabulate` (for tabular output formatting)  
- `os` (for environment variable access)  
- `python-dotenv` (for loading `.env` files)

## Installation & Running the Script

1. **Download the necessary files**:
   - The `.py` script you want to run
   - `requirements.txt` (if available)

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the same folder as the script and add your API key:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Open Command Prompt**

4. **Navigate to the script folder**:

   ```bash
   cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Script"
   ```

5. **Install required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
